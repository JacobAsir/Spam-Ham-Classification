# Spam-Ham-Classification
Built a Spam or Ham Classification model 📱

I am thrilled to announce the completion of my recent project focused on detecting and classifying SMS messages as either SPAM or HAM using Natural Language Processing (NLP). This project has been an incredible learning experience, and I am eager to share the journey and insights with you all.

🔍 Project Highlights:

➖Data Understanding and Preparation:
 Imported necessary libraries and read the data.
 Encoded and mapped values for the label column.
 Conducted exploratory data analysis with a count plot of SPAM vs. HAM .

➖Handling Imbalanced Data:
 Addressed the class imbalance to ensure model accuracy.⚖️

➖Feature Engineering:
 Created new features such as word count, presence of currency symbols, and numbers.🛠️ 
 Visualized these features with count plots.📉

➖Data Cleaning:
 Removed special characters and numbers using regular expressions.
 Converted SMS messages to lowercase.
 Tokenized messages into words.
 Removed stop words and lemmatized the words.
 Built a corpus of cleaned messages.

➖Model Building & Evaluation:
 Created a Bag of Words model.
 Developed and evaluated models using Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, and Random Forest algorithms.🤖 
 Selected the Random Forest algorithm for its superior F1 score.🏆 

➖Making Predictions:
 Successfully predicted SMS classifications .

I am excited to continue exploring the vast possibilities within NLP and machine learning, and I look forward to applying these skills in future projects.
